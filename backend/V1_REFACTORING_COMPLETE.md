# V1 API Refactoring Complete

## Overview

Successfully refactored the V1 finance API to use the new lifecycle management services with strict PO billing controls, concurrency management, and data integrity guarantees.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Controller** (`src/controllers/financeController.js`)

**Changes:**
- Replaced all PO, Bill, and Payment handlers to use new services
- Purchase Orders now use `purchaseOrderService`
- Vendor Bills now use `billService`
- Vendor Payments now use `paymentService`
- Added new endpoints:
  - `POST /api/finance/vendor-bills/:id/cancel` - Cancel bill with reason
  - `GET /api/finance/vendor-bills/:billId/payments` - Get bill payments
  - `POST /api/finance/vendor-payments/:id/void` - Void payment with reason

**New Functions:**
- `createPurchaseOrder()` - Uses lifecycle service
- `updatePurchaseOrder()` - Only allows Draft PO editing
- `updatePurchaseOrderStatus()` - Validates status transitions
- `createVendorBill()` - Enforces SUM(bills) <= PO.total with locks
- `updateVendorBill()` - Only allows editing unpaid bills with no payments
- `cancelVendorBill()` - Soft-cancel with reason tracking
- `recordVendorPayment()` - Enforces SUM(payments) <= bill.total with locks
- `voidVendorPayment()` - Void instead of delete with reversal logic

### 2. **Updated Routes** (`src/routes/financeRoutes.js`)

**New Routes:**
```javascript
POST   /api/finance/vendor-bills/:id/cancel        // Cancel bill
GET    /api/finance/vendor-bills/:billId/payments  // Get bill payments
POST   /api/finance/vendor-payments/:id/void       // Void payment
```

**Existing Routes (updated to use new services):**
```javascript
POST   /api/finance/purchase-orders                // Create PO (Draft status)
PUT    /api/finance/purchase-orders/:id            // Update PO (Draft only)
PUT    /api/finance/purchase-orders/:id/status     // Change PO status
POST   /api/finance/vendor-bills                   // Create bill (with balance check)
PUT    /api/finance/vendor-bills/:id               // Update bill (Unpaid only)
POST   /api/finance/vendor-payments                // Record payment (with balance check)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Services**

#### **Purchase Order Service** (`src/services/purchaseOrderService.js`)
Added:
- `getPurchaseOrders(filters)` - Get all POs with filters and computed fields
- Computed fields: `remainingAmount`, `canCreateBill`

#### **Bill Service** (`src/services/billService.js`)
Added:
- `getBills(filters)` - Get all bills with filters (excludes cancelled)
- `updateBill(billId, updates, userId)` - Update unpaid bills only
- Computed fields: `remainingAmount`, `canBePaid`

#### **Payment Service** (`src/services/paymentService.js`)
Added:
- `getVendorPayments(filters)` - Get all payments with filters
- `getBillPayments(billId)` - Alias for getPaymentsForBill
- Computed fields: `isVoided`, `effectiveAmount`

### 4. **Removed Files**

- `src/controllers/financeControllerV2.js` - Deleted (logic merged into V1)
- `src/routes/financeRoutesV2.js` - Deleted (no longer needed)

### 5. **Updated Server** (`src/server.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const financeRoutesV2 = require('./routes/financeRoutesV2');
app.use('/api/v2/finance', financeRoutesV2);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// V2 imports and routes removed - all logic now in V1
app.use('/api/finance', financeRoutes); // Uses new lifecycle services
```

## Implementation Features

### ✅ Strict Lifecycle Management
- **PO Lifecycle**: Draft → Sent → Partial → Completed → Cancelled
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced via `STATUS_TRANSITIONS` map
- **Auto-transitions**: PO status updates automatically based on bills

### ✅ Concurrency Controls
- **Row-Level Locking**: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`
- **Automatic Retry**: Exponential backoff on deadlocks (max 3 retries)
- **Serializable Isolation**: Prevents phantom reads and race conditions

### ✅ Data Integrity
- **Balance Enforcement**: SUM(bills) ≤ PO.total (atomic check with locks)
- **Payment Limits**: SUM(payments) ≤ bill.total (atomic check with locks)
- **Amount Validation**: Total = Subtotal + Tax (validated on create/update)
- **Financial Precision**: DECIMAL(18,4) for all monetary values

### ✅ Immutable Operations
- **Payments**: Created once, never modified - void with reversal
- **Bills**: Soft-cancel instead of deletion (cancelledAt timestamp)
- **Audit Trail**: POBillAudit tracks all state changes

### ✅ Business Rules
- **Only Draft POs** can be edited
- **Only Sent/Partial POs** can have bills created
- **Only Unpaid bills** with no payments can be edited
- **Only Unpaid bills** with no payments can be cancelled
- **Bill status** auto-updates: Unpaid → Partial → Paid (based on payments)

## API Endpoints Summary

### Purchase Orders
- `GET    /api/finance/purchase-orders` - List with filters

- `GET    /api/finance/purchase-orders/:id` - Get single
- `PUT    /api/finance/purchase-orders/:id` - Update (Draft only)
- `PUT    /api/finance/purchase-orders/:id/status` - Change status

### Vendor Bills

## Testing Checklist

### Purchase Orders
- [ ] Create PO - defaults to Draft
- [ ] Update PO - only works for Draft
- [ ] Change status Draft → Sent
- [ ] Try to edit Sent PO (should fail)
- [ ] Create bill for Sent PO
- [ ] Verify PO auto-transitions to Partial
- [ ] Create more bills until PO.billedAmount = PO.total
- [ ] Verify PO auto-transitions to Completed

### Bills
- [ ] Create bill exceeding PO remaining amount (should fail)
- [ ] Create bill within PO remaining amount
- [ ] Update unpaid bill (should work)
- [ ] Add payment to bill, try to update (should fail)
- [ ] Cancel unpaid bill with no payments
- [ ] Try to cancel bill with payments (should fail)

### Payments
- [ ] Record payment exceeding bill remaining amount (should fail)
- [ ] Record payment within bill remaining amount
- [ ] Verify bill status updates: Unpaid → Partial → Paid
- [ ] Void payment - verify reversal of amounts
- [ ] Try to void already-voided payment (should fail)

### Concurrency
- [ ] Create two bills simultaneously for same PO
- [ ] Verify only one succeeds or both succeed with correct total
- [ ] Record two payments simultaneously for same bill
- [ ] Verify amounts are correct

## Deployment Steps

1. **Stop Backend Server** (if running)
   ```bash
   # Kill any running backend processes
   ```

2. **Regenerate Prisma Client**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Verify Database Schema**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
   ```

4. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test Endpoints**
   - Use Postman or frontend to test all endpoints
   - Verify lifecycle transitions work correctly
   - Test concurrency with parallel requests

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Revert to Previous V1 Code**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 backend/src/controllers/financeController.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 backend/src/routes/financeRoutes.js
   ```

2. **Keep New Services** (they're backward compatible)
   - Services can be left in place
   - Old controller just won't use them

3. **Restart Server**

## Breaking Changes

### ⚠️ Frontend Changes Required

1. **Purchase Order Creation**
   - Status field removed from frontend form
   - Backend always creates with status='Draft'

2. **Purchase Order Editing**
   - Only Draft POs can be edited
   - Frontend should disable edit button for non-Draft POs

3. **Bill Cancellation**
   - Use new `POST /api/finance/vendor-bills/:id/cancel` endpoint
   - Must provide `reason` in request body

4. **Payment Voiding**
   - Use new `POST /api/finance/vendor-payments/:id/void` endpoint
   - Must provide `reason` in request body

### ✅ Non-Breaking Changes

1. **All GET endpoints** - Same response format (with new computed fields)
2. **Bill/Payment creation** - Same request format
3. **Status updates** - Same endpoint (with enhanced validation)

## Next Steps

1. **Update Frontend**
   - Update VendorBills.jsx to use new cancel endpoint
   - Update VendorPayments.jsx to use new void endpoint
   - Add UI for bill cancellation with reason
   - Add UI for payment voiding with reason

2. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Test service layer functions
   - Test concurrency scenarios
   - Test error handling

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test full PO lifecycle
   - Test bill creation and payment flow
   - Test concurrent operations

4. **Monitor in Production**
   - Watch for concurrency errors
   - Monitor transaction retry rates
   - Track audit trail entries
